### Hi there

I'm a front-end developer at Cognitiv+, automating document review for lawyers with AI - and I'm an ex-lawyer myself. 

I lead the re-design of the front end from MVP to v1.0, using **Figma** and **FigJam** to adapt our **SvelteKit, SASS / SCSS** and **GraphQL** app. As well as **JavaScript/TypeScript**, I'm a front-end dev who actually enjoys writing up-to-date **CSS** and tackling responsive and accessible websites. On the side, I'm studying more server side development with **Kit** and **Next**.

With a legal background and experience in the UK, Balkans, and Japan, I have a diverse set of soft skills: project management, adaptability to start-ups or cross-border and cross-functional teams, and collaboration with people from different countries and cultures.

**I write React or Svelte, but I'd be very happy to learn other frameworks, libraries and state management solutions.**
